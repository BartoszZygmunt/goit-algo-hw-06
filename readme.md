### Conclusion

The comparison between DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) for finding paths in the city's transportation network revealed significant differences:

- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**:

  - Path: `['Station', 'Mall', 'Hospital', 'School', 'Park']`
  - DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. This often results in longer paths because it doesn't prioritize finding the shortest path first. In our case, DFS took a longer route through multiple nodes before reaching the target.

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**:
  - Path: `['Station', 'School', 'Park']`
  - BFS explores all neighbors of a node level by level, ensuring that the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) is found. This method provided a direct and shorter path from 'Station' to 'Park'.

The BFS algorithm is more effective in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it systematically explores all possible paths level by level. In contrast, DFS can be less efficient for this purpose as it might explore deeper paths first without considering shorter alternatives. This distinction is crucial when choosing the appropriate algorithm for pathfinding tasks in various types of graphs and networks.
